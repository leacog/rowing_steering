rowing steering
---

- pcb max size 22x100mm (standing verticaly)
- LEDs and buttons at the top, battery connectors under that, than arduino, and then outgoing balance plugs and
connections to the servo (power from big batteries and servo pin)
- keep arduino usb port unobstructed


oar buttons
---

- as thin as possible, not too long either
- arduino nano, a battery holder (big enough to get needed voltage, can be either LiPo or a button cell, how long would they last?
I think arduino should take ~50mA, everything <100mA), two sets of through holes to solder in the leads from flexible buttons,
a power switch
- pick the needed parts on digikey
- 3 LEDs at some visible place
